Hello ðŸ‘‹! I'm Eitan Turok. I like building things. And I am an obsessive learner ðŸ“š. 
<br>
<br>
I am majoring in CS and Applied Mathematics at Columbia University. I am generally interested in deep learning (efficient training, geometric DL, interpretability) and theoretical CS (fine-grained complexity, graph algorithms).
<br>
<br>
I do research under [Prof Itsik Peâ€™er](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/itsik-peer) predicting diseases from the microbiome with non-Eculdidean embeddings. I also do research under [Prof Josh Alman](https://joshalman.com/) on the fine-grained complexity of dynamic programming problems.
