I am generally interested in deep learning (efficient training, geometric DL, interpretability) and theoretical CS (fine-grained complexity, graph algorithms).   I do research under Prof Itsik Pe’er predicting diseases from the microbiome with non-Eculdidean embeddings. I also do research under Prof Josh Alman on the fine-grained complexity of dynamic programming problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlog Posts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nPost With Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnews\n\n\ncode\n\n\nanalysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAug 20, 2023\n\n\nHarlow Malloc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nWelcome To My Blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAug 17, 2023\n\n\nTristan O’Malley\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
